  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm currently 24 years old and have lived in Chicago all my life. Growing up in Chicago as a Vietnamese-American was good because we had a close tight-knit Vietnamese community over there on Broadway and Argyle. As I grew up, I picked up on how to speak and understand Vietnamese from my parents and never went to school to actually learn the language. I have two much older siblings. My brother is 10 years older than me and my sister is 13 years older than me. They actually went to Vietnamese school so their Vietnamese is a lot better than mine, especially since they can also read and write it.

    Although I can generally speak my Vietnamese dialect, I can understand a fair amount more. I can also read and write on an very basic level. Technically I can’t write because I don’t know how to place accents on letters. Although, I do know how to spell the word out without accents. In the Vietnamese language the accents on the letters in words matter a lot because it sets the tone for the word which can mean one thing or another.

    I have also never travelled to my home country, Vietnam. It’s not that I don’t want to, it’s just that I never got the chance to. My parents and siblings all have been to Vietnam of course with my parents being born in Vietnam and my siblings travelling there when they were younger. The only place I have travelled to when I was younger was Finland, where I have a lot of family who have lived there their whole life.

    Aside from my family and Vietnamese background, I am currently pursuing a technical background at IIT. I am a 4th year undergraduate student majoring in Informational Technology and Management (ITM) and I am also a co-terminal student with a concentration in Web Design and Application Development. Other than this class being credit needed for graduation, I wanted to brush up or a strong refresher on HTML/CSS and JavaScript as well as gain further knowledge and skills in this field that I can take along with me after I graduate.

    I also wanted to learn the proper standardizations and semantics to web pages as well as good practices on what to do while building a web page. This can also be tied in with my Ambitions. I graduate next semester, Fall 2020, so I hope that everything I learn and gain from this course and all my other courses, I can confidently list those skills I’ve obtained onto my resume and have projects to put in my portfolio. Ultimately, my goal is to have a successful career while making enough money to support my family.
