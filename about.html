  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm currently 24 years old and have lived in Chicago all my life. Growing up in Chicago as a Vietnamese-American was good because we had a close tight-knit Vietnamese community over there on Broadway and Argyle. As I grew up, I picked up on how to speak and understand Vietnamese from my parents and never went to school to actually learn the language. I have two older siblings, much older. My brother is 10 years apart from me and my sister is 13 years apart from me. They actually went to Vietnamese school so their Vietnamese is a lot better than mine, especially since they can also read and write it.

    Although I can brokenly speak my Vietnamese dialect, I can understand a fair amount more. I can also read and write on an extremely basic level. Technically I can’t write because I don’t know how to place accents on letters, I only know how to spell the word out and in the Vietnamese language the accents on the letters in words matter a lot because it sets
    the tone for the word which can mean one thing or another. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I have also never been to my home country of Vietnam. It’s not that I don’t want to, it’s just that I never got the chance to. My parents and siblings all have been to Vietnam of course with my parents being born in Vietnam and my siblings travelling there when they were younger.

    Aside from my Vietnamese background, I am currently pursuing a technical background at IIT. I am a 4th year undergraduate student majoring in Informational Technology and Management (ITM) and I am also a co-terminal student with a concentration in Web Design and Application Development. Which brings me to why I chose this course, besides the fact that it covers communications and humanities credits. I wanted to brush up or a refresher on HTML/CSS and JavaScript as well as gain further knowledge and skills in this field that I can take along with me after I graduate in hopes for a successful career.

    I also wanted to learn the proper standardizations and semantics to web pages as well as good practices on what to do while building a web page. This can also be tied in with my Ambitions. I graduate next semester so I hope that everything I learn and gain from this course and all my other courses, I can confidently list the skills I’ve obtained on my resume and have great projects to put on my portfolio. Ultimately, I would love to have a great paying stable job where I am able to support my family and live happily.
